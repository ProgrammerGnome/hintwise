# hintwise
Simple Android app providing hints for KöMaL problems that inspire creative thinking.

## Features / Key ideas
- Stores KöMaL problems in plain text format for offline access.  
- Allows users to **randomly draw problems**, displaying LaTeX formulas with proper rendering.  
- Provides **hints on demand** for the drawn problems:  
  - Hints only present the *necessary background knowledge* for solving the task.  
  - No explicit solution strategy is revealed.  
  - Uses the free and public **DeepSeek API** to generate the hints.
